<h1>The best movies according to Mihai's perspective</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

    <h3>The Lord of the rings - the trilogy</h3>
      <p>
        In my opinion this trilogy is the best ever made in history of cinematic movies
      </p>
    <h3>Mission Impossible</h3>
      <p>
        All of the Mission Impossible movies feature impressive action sequences, compelling storylines, and my favorite actor, Tom Cruise.
      </p>
    <h3>Get out</h3>
      <p>
        One of the best horror movies ever made.
